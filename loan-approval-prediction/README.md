#  Loan Approval Prediction

###  Project Overview
This project analyzes loan application data to identify key factors that influence loan approval decisions. The goal is to create a predictive model using financial and demographic data to help banks make more efficient and data-driven decisions.

###  Dataset
[Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/krishnaraj30/finance-loan-approval-prediction-data)

###  Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Google Colab for code execution and notebooks
- Power BI / Tableau for dashboard creation (planned)
- GitHub for documentation and version control

###  Business Questions
- What features most influence loan approvals?
- Can we build a model to predict whether a loan will be approved?
- How can banks use this model to streamline decisions?

###  Visualizations
*To be added in `/visuals`*
- Approval rate by credit history
- Income vs. Loan Amount
- Education vs Approval Status

###  Model Summary
Multiple models were trained and evaluated:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Performance was compared using:
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision and Recall

Features used:
- Applicant Income  
- Credit History  
- Loan Amount  
- Property Area  
- Education  
- Self Employment  
- Property Area
