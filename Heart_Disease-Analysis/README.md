## Project Overview
This project analyzes synthetic health data to explore symptoms and lifestyle factors associated with heart disease risk. The goal is to demonstrate data visualization and analytics skills using Excel and Power BI.

## Dataset

- Contains binary and numeric features like chest pain, high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, etc.
- Label: Heart_Risk (0 = Low risk, 1 = High risk)

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel: Data cleaning, transformation, and basic analysis
- Power BI: Advanced interactive visualizations, KPI dashboards
- GitHub: Version control and documentation

## Business Questions
- Which symptoms and lifestyle factors are most correlated with heart disease risk?
- How does age affect heart disease risk?
- What patterns or combinations of symptoms most frequently lead to high risk?

## Visual Analytics (Power BI)
- Heart risk breakdown by age group
- Risk correlation with obesity, diabetes, and high BP
- Symptom frequency in high-risk vs. low-risk patients
- KPI dashboard: % at high risk, risk by gender, etc.
