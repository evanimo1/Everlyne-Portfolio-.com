# Loan Approval Analysis & Prediction

## Project Overview
This project analyzes loan application data to identify key drivers of loan approval decisions. Using financial and demographic features, I developed an interactive Power BI KPI dashboard and performed exploratory and predictive analysis to uncover approval patterns and translate insights into actionable recommendations for data-driven lending decisions.

## Dataset
[Kaggle Loan Approval Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/krishnaraj30/finance-loan-approval-prediction-data)

---

## Tools Used
- **Python** (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **Google Colab** for data processing and model development
- **Power BI** for KPI dashboards and visual analytics
- **GitHub** for version control and documentation

---

## Business Questions
- Which factors most strongly influence loan approval decisions?
- How can historical loan data inform predictive modeling for approvals?
- How can banks use these insights to streamline and improve lending decisions?

---

## Key Visual Analytics
Insights were explored using an interactive Power BI dashboard, including:
- Approval rate by credit history
- Approval rate by education level
- Approval rate by property area
- Income vs. loan amount trends
- KPI overview of approval and rejection rates

---

## Model Summary
Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated to assess predictive potential:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Model performance was compared using:
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision and Recall

### Features Used
- Applicant Income  
- Coapplicant Income  
- Credit History  
- Loan Amount  
- Loan Amount Term  
- Education  
- Self Employed  
- Property Area
