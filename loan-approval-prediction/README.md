Loan Approval Prediction

This project explores and predicts loan approval decisions using machine learning. It involves cleaning financial and demographic data, performing exploratory analysis, and evaluating multiple classification models to identify the most accurate one.

 Project Objective

To build a model that predicts whether a loan should be approved based on features like income, credit history, and employment. This model can help financial institutions automate and enhance loan decision-making.

🧹 Step 1: Data Cleaning (Loan_Approval_Prediction.ipynb)

Handled missing values using imputation

Converted categorical variables using one-hot encoding

Cleaned data exported and ready for modeling

 Step 2: Model Building (Model_Building.ipynb)

Trained and evaluated three classification models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

 The best model is selected based on:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Precision & Recall

 Visualizations (To be added in /visuals)

Loan Approval by Credit History

Loan Amount vs Income

Loan Status by Education and Gender

Dataset

Source: Kaggle - Loan Approval Dataset

Skills Demonstrated

Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

Machine Learning model training & evaluation

Exploratory data analysis

Git & GitHub collaboration
