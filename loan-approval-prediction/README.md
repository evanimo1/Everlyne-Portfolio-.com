#  Loan Approval Prediction

###  Project Overview
This project analyzes loan application data to identify key factors that influence loan approval decisions. The goal is to create a predictive model using financial and demographic data to help banks make more efficient and data-driven decisions.

###  Dataset
[Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/krishnaraj30/finance-loan-approval-prediction-data)

###  Tools Used
- R / Excel for data analysis and modeling
- Power BI / Tableau for dashboard creation
- GitHub for documentation and version control

###  Business Questions
- What features most influence loan approvals?
- Can we build a model to predict whether a loan will be approved?
- How can banks use this model to streamline decisions?

###  Visualizations
*To be added in `/visuals`*
- Approval rate by credit history
- Income vs. Loan Amount
- Education vs Approval Status

###  Model Summary
A logistic regression model will be trained using features like:
- Applicant Income
- Credit History
- Loan Amount
- Property Area
